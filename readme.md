# HTML and CSS

- **Semantic HTML**: HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a `<header>` tag is semantic because it tells the browser that this is the header of the page. This is important for accessibility and SEO. It does not happend when a `<div>` tag is used instead of a `<header>` tag.
