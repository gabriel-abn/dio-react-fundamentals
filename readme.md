# HTML and CSS

- **Semantic HTML**: HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a `<header>` tag is semantic because it tells the browser that this is the header of the page. This is important for accessibility and SEO. It does not happend when a `<div>` tag is used instead of a `<header>` tag.

- **CSS Selectors**: CSS selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web page that we want to style. There are many different types of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, id selectors, and pseudo-selectors.

```css
/* Element Selector */
h1 {
  color: red;
}

/* Class Selector */
.my-class {
  color: blue;
}

/* ID Selector */
#my-id {
  color: green;
}

/* Pseudo-Selector */
a:hover {
  color: purple;
}
```
